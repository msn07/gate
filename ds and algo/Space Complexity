Space Complexity:
=================

	How much memory space is required in order to finish the algorithm/program. This has to analyzed in terms of given input size. 

	If the input size is 
	
		n -- with reference to this what is amount of space required to complete the algo.

		If you need n extra cells -- O(n)
		constant space		  -- O(1)
					  -- O(n ^ 2)

	Iterative Program:
	==================

	1.	Algo(A, 1, n) {
			int i, j=10;			-- constant space for i & j 
			for(i=1 to j)
				A[i] = 0; 
		}

		In this algo irrespective of the input size, you need a constant space. So the space complexity required for this algo is

		O(1)

	2. 	Algo(A, 1, n) {
			int i;			-- constanst space
			create B[n];		-- n extra cells
			for(i= 1 to n) 
				B[i] = A[i];
		}	

		So the space complexity for this algo is (1 + n) which is 

		O(n)

	3. 	Algo(A, 1, n) {
			create B[n, n]		-- n ^ 2
			int i, j;		-- 2
			for(i=1 to n)		
			   for(j=1 to n) 
				B[i, j] = A[i];
		}

		So the space complexity for this algo is (2 + n ^ 2) which is 

		O(n ^ 2)
